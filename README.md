# AugmentedRealityInAutomation
The Concept: 
With the advance of Design and UX capability in the age of digitization, the Software QA always face the challenge to keep up the pace. 
The conventional Test Driven (TDD) or Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) approach it is still cumbersome to automate in-sprint test cases 

Availability of Application Under Test (AUT) becomes prerequisite of automation scripting in most of the cases 
The potential of Design and UX team remains underutilized in the domain of Software QA and testing.

The effective implementation of Augmented Reality in this area can help us resolving the above challenges in our conventional way of automation. 
The design doc or wireframe to be integrated with UI Automation tool like Sikuli and a record and play IDE like Katalon or Slenium IDE 
etc. to get the output as automated script.
